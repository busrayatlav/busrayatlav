# Hi there! 👋 I’m @busrayatlav 🚀

- 👀 I’m into all things urban: mobility, sustainability, and making cities smarter (and maybe less stressful, too).
- 🌱 Currently leveling up my data science game with some Python magic, GIS wizardry, and machine learning sorcery. 🧙‍♀️
- 💞️ Let’s team up! Especially if it involves Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS), traffic taming, or making urban mobility platforms shine. 🚦
- 📫 Find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/busrayatlav) or slide into my inbox at busrayatlav@gmail.com. 📬

Feel free to drop by and say hi. Let's make the world (or at least its cities) a better place together!
